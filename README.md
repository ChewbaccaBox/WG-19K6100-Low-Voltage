# WG-19K6100-Low-Voltage
My version of the low voltage replacement board for the 6100 monitor.
Larger / Through-hole parts provide beter thermals.
Adjustable voltage range = +/- 23.5v - 28.5v

TESTING STATUS:
Has been made, assmebled, and put into a 6100 deflection board.
Produces correct voltages when power applied.
I haven't yet tried it with everything hooked up but it should work.
Also therefore don't know how durable/long-lasting it is.
